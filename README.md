## Password Keeper details and how to start using it.
#### Steps to start

1. Change (in line 33 of file passwordkeeper.py) the variable "yourpassword" to something that you want it to be your password don't forget it because you'll need to use it to enter the program.

2. Now you wan't to run the file but you have 2 options, the first being, simple run the passwordkeeper.py or use the batch file. 

2. EXTRA:     Open the .bat file and change the 2nd line to ,for example, python C:\Users\programming\python\passwordkeeper.py and locate your .bat file in the directory your cmd opens on, for example in C:Users\yourusername, when that is done, u wan't to run your cmd and type your .bat file name (if u didn't change it it will be just "pass")

3. After this, the program will run and you'll see that it's UI is realy simple and easy to use

4. Now it's time to close the program for example typing "quit" or "exit" and now you are going to open the file passwordkeeper.py and comment it with "#" in the beggining of each line or using """ the code """ or even eliminating(i would suggest to just comment it out so if u need to use it another time..) from the line 23 to 44, inside the file it has some indications so u don't miss.

5. You're done! Now you just need to play with it so u get used to it and then if you want u can delete the Passwordkeeper.db and redo the step number 4 backwards(basically u would uncoment out from the line 23 to the 44 and run the code once so it set's the password and then comment it out again)

#### I'm accepting suggestions for new functions or upgrades i could do, for example if a lot of people ask i could do this program but in tkinter because i know a lot of it so it wouldn't be that difficult.

#### If you got any error just copy the error from the console and then post here on the "issues" column so i can search and try to fix it.

#### If a lot of people like this program i can keep making changes to it that a lot of people request ( i have a request column aka to-do list ) btw im working on searching function rn.

#### If this has errors or this post doesn't look that good or something it's because it's my first time publishing something here on github so be kind with me :D
